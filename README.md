# Hierarchical Multiscale Convolutional Neural Network (HMSCNN) for Fault Diagnosis in Rotating Machinery

## Introduction
This repository contains the implementation of the Hierarchical Multiscale Convolutional Neural Network (HMSCNN) designed for fault diagnosis in rotating machinery. The project is structured to handle multiple datasets and provides utilities for training and visualization.

## File Structure
- **train.py**: Main script to initiate the training process.
- **train_utils.py**: Contains utility functions for training, model loading, metrics computation, etc.
- **MFPT.py**: Data loader and preprocessor for the MFPT dataset.
- **XJTU.py**: Data loader and preprocessor for the XJTU dataset.
- **BoxHistoPlots.py**: Provides functionalities for generating box plots and histograms.
- **CMMExtraction.py**: Script to extract condition monitoring metrics from files.
- **plotter.py**: General-purpose plotting utilities.
